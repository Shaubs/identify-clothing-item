# identify-clothing-item
The program takes image inputs and identifies if it is a shirt or a pant

As a college student who has no access to a washing machine , doing my laundry is a tiresome task.What bugs me most is that after washing and hanging my clothes the task is not complete. We still need to turn that pile of dry clothes into neat stacks of folded shirts and pants.As Sheldon from Big Bang Theory has shown us , the world already has a folding machine.But you still have to take out a shirt or a pant and have the machine fold it accordingly. I'm lazier than Sheldon. I just want to pick up the pile of clothes and dump it on the machine and let it fold it for me. For that I decided to make this clothes sorting code.
